You need to explain why you want to submit late and only if the instructor has confirmed, you can submit assignment late. Instructor retains the rights to decide in this matter In case you are going through emergency, do not worry about the late submission. You can submit assignment once you are out of the emergency. Of course, late submission in this case will only be accepted if the reasons you have provided are valid. Instructor retains the rights to decide in this matter Assignments have to completed without any collaboration or help. There will be penalty if we find signs of plagiarism Codes developed to complete the assignments should also be independent and graders will check if there is plagiarism or code is copied from online sources Instead of engaging in such activities, you are encouraged to get help from TAs and instructor and complete the assignments independently  Projects/exams #  In order to encourage collaboration and exchange of ideas, we will assign two projects during the semester. Some points:\n projects are more challenging than the assignments we will form the group of 5 students and each group will complete the project members within group will work together to complete the project, however, the final reports that you will submit has to be prepared individually you will get about 2-3 weeks of time (depending on the complexity) to complete the project  Regarding late submissions, we will follow the rules of Assignments section above.\nFinal project/exam #  Depending on the performance of class, you will either get a project as a final exam or in-class exam. More details will be available at later times.\nImportant remarks #   Depending on the performance of class, we may or may not have a mid-term exam. You will of course be made aware at least 2-3 weeks ahead of time. I reserve the right to give a Q or F grade, or otherwise terminate, a student’s class registration for any reason that I believe to be disruptive to the learning process of the student or of the class.  Special notes #  The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic adjustments for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TDD or the College of Engineering Director of Students with Disabilities at 471-4321.\nEvaluation #  Note that the Measurement and Evaluation Center forms for the Cockrell School of Engineering will be used during the last week of class to evaluate the course and the instructor. You may also want to note any other methods of evaluation you plan to employ.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/BME-313L-website/docs/lectures/","title":"Lectures","section":"Docs","content":"Lectures #  Lectures, hopefully, will be face-to-face. Since we will do some coding and also little bit of theory, the lectures will be delivered with a mix of presentation and handwritten notes. The notes and slides will be available in the github repository of this course.\nOn the right-side of website, you can find the list of lectures.
